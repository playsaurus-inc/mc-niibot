An example would be the number after e in your gold.\nIn some guides SciNot is known as Log10. SciNot is eventually forced, and agreed by most to be easier to understand than Standard Notation.\nIn this game, Standard is just a hybrid of written form and SciNot. Each subsequent letter correlates to a multiple of e3. It's much simpler to read and understand the context of 1.845e24 than 1.845 septillion.\nHere's a short video on how to read and convert to and from SciNot: <https://youtu.be/bXkewQ7WEdI>" })
