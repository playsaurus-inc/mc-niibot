Priority ancients are Siya/Lib/Nog if idle, Frags/Jugg/Bhaal/Pluto if active or hybrid, and Kuma/Atman regardless of build. Use one of the ancient calculators in <#207675653091229697> to level them. Ascend when you fail bosses past zone 130, and  make sure to have bought all ancients by around 1M HS. Driej's outsider calculator also provides a rough estimate to when to transcend in the yellow box, assuming an active/hybrid build. Transcend every 3-4 ascensions that **gain Ancient Souls** following this." })
